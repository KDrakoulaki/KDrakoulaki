	abstract = {While many theoretical proposals about the relationship between language and music processing have been proposed over the past 40 years, recent empirical advances have shed new light on this relationship. Many features are shared between language and music, inspiring research in the fields of linguistic theory, systematic musicology, and cognitive (neuro-)science. This research has led to many and diverse findings, making comparisons difficult. In the current review, we propose a framework within which to organise past research and conduct future research, suggesting that past research has assumed either domain-specificity or domain-generality for language and music. Domain-specific approaches theoretically and experimentally describe aspects of language and music processing assuming that there is shared (structure-building) processing. Domain-general approaches theoretically and experimentally describe how mechanisms such as cognitive control, attention or neural entrainment can explain language and music processing. Here we propose that combining elements from domain-specific and domain-general approaches can be beneficial for advances in theoretical and experimental work, as well as for diagnoses and interventions for atypical populations. We provide examples of past research which has implicitly merged domain-specific and domain-general assumptions, and suggest new experimental designs that can result from such a combination aiming to further our understanding of the human brain.},
